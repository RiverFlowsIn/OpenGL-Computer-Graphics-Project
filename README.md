## Application of this project in the Biomedical fields

- we can use it in rehabiliation.

## Issues 

- we faced some problems at the first to create animation and the robot was move in wrong way and we solve it after watch the section video.

- The lighting was not good at all and we change the constants that control the lighting and solve it.

- The football goal was moving wrong when we move the camera backward or forward and it was a mistake in the position of the object in the display function.
